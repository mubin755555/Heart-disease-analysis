# Heart-disease-analysis


This repository contains a data analysis project focused on heart disease, which aims to explore and analyze various factors that contribute to the presence of heart disease. This project was completed using Google Colab for data analysis and visualizations, leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals and their health indicators, to understand which factors may correlate with heart disease. This analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of results to provide insights into heart disease predictors.

## Dataset
The dataset, `heart.csv`, contains several features that include:
- **Age**: Age of the individual
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain (4 types)
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure value at rest
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- **Resting ECG**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise
- **Exercise-Induced Angina**: Whether exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **Number of Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thalassemia**: Thalassemia type
- **Target**: Heart disease presence indicator (1 = presence, 0 = absence)

The dataset is used to identify the relationships between these features and the likelihood of heart disease.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis includes:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore patterns in the dataset.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating correlations between features and the target variable.
4. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most impactful features on the target outcome.

## Results and Insights
- The analysis provided insights into which factors are most associated with heart disease.
- Visualizations show the distributions and relationships between features.
- Correlations were established to guide further research and potential preventive measures.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: Development environment.
